My career has been an exciting journey through various roles, always with a focus on blending technology and design to deliver top-notch user experiences.

At Unqork, I've been a key player since day one, helping to build the Platform UI team and develop the Unqork Design System (UQDS). This system has become a cornerstone of the platform, enhancing its functionality and user experience. I've also worked on integrating this system into component settings and pioneering innovative component creation using cutting-edge methodologies.

Before Unqork, I worked at Present Day, where I led full-stack development projects, including a major application for Paraguay's largest testing laboratory. My work demonstrated my ability to deliver advanced solutions while collaborating across time zones and cultures.

At Adoptive, I played a crucial role in projects like YaleMedicine.org and Bundoo.com, earning an honorable mention at the Webby Awards. My contributions to user experience design and strategic planning were instrumental in these successes.

I'm passionate about communication, mentoring, and driving innovation. Whether it's through developing robust applications or enhancing user interfaces, I strive to create impactful and enjoyable digital experiences.
