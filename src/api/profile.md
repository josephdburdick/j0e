A life's work of embracing both the creative and the technical, developing innovative web
applications and enhancing user experiences.

I have spent my entire adult life—and most of my (curious) childhood—immersed in web development and
the technologies that power it. As a somewhat unconventional child, I created E3R, a multi-user
anonymous journal, in high school in the late 90s. This platform allowed people from around the
world to express their feelings anonymously, creating a virtual refuge that attracted a
global readership. E3R not only provided a therapeutic outlet for its users but also served as a
portfolio piece that ultimately granted me access to higher education.

By my early twenties, I had already accumulated extensive experience in web development, design,
and project management. Over the years, I have contributed to numerous projects, continuously
expanding my expertise and passion for creating exceptional digital experiences.

Most recently, I have been a Senior Software Engineer at Unqork, a SaaS platform based in New York City.
As a founding member of the Platform UI team, I played a pivotal role in developing the
Unqork Design System (UQDS), which significantly enhanced the platform's functionality and user experience.
I transitioned to the Module Builder team to integrate the design system into component settings,
contributing to the creation of 92 module definitions leveraging UQDS. Currently, I am part of
the Experience Engineering team, working on innovative component creation using the Vega engine.
Unqork is now valued at over $2 billion.

I currently reside in Brooklyn but have lived a nomadic lifestyle from 2018 to 2022,
working remotely since 2014. For fun, I collect pool table locations from around the world
and casually play (bar rules only). I am also a casual photographer, enjoying candid street
shots along with abstract art and graffiti.
