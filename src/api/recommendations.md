      I had the pleasure of working with Joe for over 2 years on various projects. Joe is one of the nicest and hardworking individuals I have ever met. Joe has a very good eye for catching things that can be simplified which often helped our team immensely. 

      Joe has a lot of patience which is a very good asset to have and it was evident in the way he was able to successfully handle long running tasks while also maintaining excellent communication with the team on the progress of the task. He’s always available to help his teammates when they are in need.

      Any team would be lucky to have him and I strongly recommend Joe.

      I had the pleasure to manage Joe during my time at Unqork. Joe is someone I consider to be a craftsman. His approach when working with code is to leave the code better than he found it. He has a passion for user interface and for making things right for the users and developers. 

      One notable project Joe worked on was the company's internal design system. As part of his work, Joe assisted teams throughout the platform with getting the most from the system and helping them leverage the components to reduce code and styling. This work greatly improved readability, maintainability and consistency. In addition, Joe is a person I enjoyed working with.

      I had the pleasure of working with Joe at Unqork, and he is a fantastic engineer with a remarkable eye for UI/UX and accessibility. Joe excels at asking insightful questions and raising important considerations, helping teams break down work and fully understand requirements. His deeply analytical mindset enables him to solve business challenges in a holistic and effective manner.

      Joe is not only a skilled problem-solver but also a great team player. He actively supports his teammates, always being one of the first to jump on calls to answer questions or provide a second pair of eyes. His commitment to driving code quality is evident through his thorough PR comments and willingness to pair with other developers.

      I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with Joe, and I believe he would be a brilliant addition to any team.

      Joe epitomizes the qualities of what like to call a responsible engineer. It's one thing to be good at writing code (which Joe is) and it's another to go the extra mile.

      He just doesn't do the work that he's assigned to do. Joe makes sure to understand the why. This is how you get output from an engineering team that is high quality, that catches edge cases, and that truly solves the problems presenting your users, by having an engineer like Joe asking the right questions and leading by example.

      I count myself lucky I had the opportunity to rely on his work and envy whoever gets to work with him in his career.

      Over the two years that I've known Joe, since meeting at Adoptive, I've had the opportunity to work with and get to know one of the most hardworking, creative, resolute and generous people I've met in my career thus far. Joe's work ethic is impeccable, and he is a genuinely generous person who gives of himself to both his work and his team. 

      Joe is an asset--any team would be very lucky to have him!

      I wanted to take a moment to recommend Joe Burdick. I have worked with Joe not only in his current role as Founder of Joey Labs but also during both of our time at SGC. Having worked with Joe on multiple projects I am extremely confident in his abilities and work ethic which both exceed what I am accustomed to. Joe is my first call when I have a technical question and he has never ceased to amaze me with his insight and can-do attitude. He is extremely knowledgable and is a problem solver. Joe is a rare find, a pleasure to work with and as a result of his expertise and professionalism is an extremely valuable addition to any team.
